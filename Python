Installed Python 3.10. I installed it in a custom mode because I have another Python version in my computer due to ArcGIS (Python 2.6)
To check version of python simply open cmd and type this: python --version   You can be in any address no need to change directory. 

To open python simply type: python    no need to change directory. 

To exit from python simply type: exit()

To know where your python is saved in your local computer just type: where python   no need to change directory. 

I uninstalled the stand alone Python that I installed (3.10) because I found out that Anaconda installs Python automatically along with Jupyter.

Then I installed Anaconda 3. Anaconda 3 has Python 3.9

open anaconda prompt in start 

you'll see 
(base) C:\Users\Beth> 

type:

python --version   to know what python version you have 

conda info         to know what conda version you have

conda list         to know the packages you have 

conda install numpy     if you want to install any of the packages in the list. This is an example. Numpy is a package in python and in Anaconda. 

jupyter notebook        it will give you a link which you can open in your browser to open the GUI of jupyter
                        Remember to quit the GUI when you're done so you can stop the session from constantly running. I opened a port local8888 previously 
                        and I just closed the tab and did not quit. When I opened another session of Jupyter in the anaconda prompt it says there is another 
                        port being used local8888, "Or the port 8888 is already in use".
                        
conda install pandas    i installed this 


Then the .ipynb files I uploaded first in the Jupyter dashboard. To do this save the .ipynb file in your desired folder and then in the dashboard upper 
right hand corner look for the upload button. Click this and look for the file you need to upload. Then you will find that it comes up in the dashboard. 
You're probably going to click another button to be able to put it in the dashboard. Then you can double click this to open this file. Then start running 
the scripts in the files. Remember than the [*] means the script is still running so don't click run on the next script just yet. 




installation 

Anaconda took me probably 3 to 5  minutes to install. It's file size in my pc is not showing. 
installed numpy  - less than one minute
installed pandas - less than one minute

How to start testing
ran first instruction - ok 
second instruction - ok 
third instruction - ok 
fourth instruction - uploaded the .ipynb file in the dashboard first before opening it. 
fifth instruction - I ran it it seems ok; 


Jupyter notebook files to test
File 1 Access_CSV_from_S3 -
ran file 1 Access_CSV_from_S3 - start 13:04, end 13:09  - each script ran


File 2  Data_analysis_examples
Ran file 2 Data_analysis_examples  - start 13:59, end 14:08 each script ran
