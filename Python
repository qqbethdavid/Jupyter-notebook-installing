Installed Python 3.10. I installed it in a custom mode because I have another Python version in my computer due to ArcGIS (Python 2.6)
To check version of python simply open cmd and type this: python --version   You can be in any address no need to change directory. 

To open python simply type: python    no need to change directory. 

To exit from python simply type: exit()

To know where your python is saved in your local computer just type: where python   no need to change directory. 

I uninstalled the stand alone Python that I installed (3.10) because I found out that Anaconda installs Python automatically along with Jupyter.

Then I installed Anaconda 3. Anaconda 3 has Python 3.9
