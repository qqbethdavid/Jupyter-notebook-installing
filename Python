Installed Python 3.10. I installed it in a custom mode because I have another Python version in my computer due to ArcGIS (Python 2.6)
To check version of python simply open cmd and type this: python --version   You can be in any address no need to change directory. 

To open python simply type: python    no need to change directory. 

To exit from python simply type: exit()

To know where your python is saved in your local computer just type: where python   no need to change directory. 

I uninstalled the stand alone Python that I installed (3.10) because I found out that Anaconda installs Python automatically along with Jupyter.

Then I installed Anaconda 3. Anaconda 3 has Python 3.9

open anaconda prompt in start 

you'll see 
(base) C:\Users\Beth> 

type:

python --version   to know what python version you have 

conda info         to know what conda version you have

conda list         to know the packages you have 

conda install numpy     if you want to install any of the packages in the list. This is an example. Numpy is a package in python and in Anaconda.
